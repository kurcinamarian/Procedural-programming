Number 8 is larger.

## Task 5.3
Write a program that reads real numbers a, b, and c from the input. Using the function kvadraticka_rovnica, determine the roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (you can find how to solve a quadratic equation on Wikipedia). The function kvadraticka_rovnica will return the number of roots and their values. The program will print the return values to the console. Assume that the coefficient a is non-zero (what happens if it equals 0, and how does that affect the program?). Use the sqrt function from the math library to calculate the square root.

The program will print the addresses and values of the variables pointed to by the pointers before and after calling the vymen_ukazovatele procedure.

## Task 5.5
Write a function int delitele(int x[], int pocetx, int y[], int k) that copies all divisors of k from array x into array y, preserving the order in which they appear in x. The function will return the number of elements in array y. The argument pocetx indicates the number of elements in array x (which is statically allocated). You can assume that array y has sufficient space for all the divisors of k found in array x.

## Task 5.6
Write a program that first reads the dimensions of an array m (a non-negative integer). In the function alokuj_1D_pole(...), dynamically allocate the array, then fill it with numbers entered via the keyboard. Afterward, the program will use the function vypis_1D_pole(...) to print the entire array to the console. The program will then find and print the maximum and minimum values in the array using the functions maximum_poz(...) and minimum_poz(...), which also return the positions where these values are located. Before the program finishes, it should free the allocated memory via the uvolni() function.

## Task 7.1
Create a program that checks if a given square is a magic square. A square is magic if the sum of the elements in all rows, columns, and diagonals is the same. The program will create a static array of size N × N (for example, N = 20). It will then read the square's size n from the standard input (where n <= N) and load the elements of the square into the static array. If n < N, the program will not use the entire square, but just a part of it. If n > N, the program will terminate with an error message. The program will then check if the square is magic in the function int magicky(). Finally, the program will print the result on the screen.

Examples of magic squares:

8 1 6  
3 5 7  
4 9 2  

16 3 2 13  
5 10 11 8

## Task 7.3
Test the functions for working with strings presented in the lecture. Create your own array of strings, read them from the keyboard, and print it to the screen. Try to allocate only as much space as needed. At the end of the program, properly free the array of strings.

## Task 9.1
The cinema doorman was assigned the task of figuring out who visits the cinema most frequently. Help him by writing a program that does this for him. The input consists of names, each represented as a string without spaces. The output of the program will be a list of the names that visited the cinema most frequently. Assume that at most 100 different people go to the cinema (you can represent this as a static array).

Hint: You can use the strcmp() function from the string.h library for comparing strings.

## Task 9.2
Modify Task 9.1 so that the array used to store the names uses only as much space as necessary (represent it as a dynamic array). Properly free the array at the end of the program.

## Task 9.3
In Task 9.2, add a function hladaj_max() (the array will be passed as an input argument to the function), which will output the name that appeared most frequently in the cinema.
